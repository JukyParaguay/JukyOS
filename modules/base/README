This module implements the core functionality of olpc-os-builder.
You don't want to exclude it.

[base] options:

- versioned_fs (default 1)
Set to 0 to disable the "upgradeable" /versions-based filesystem layout.

- make_iso (default 1)
Set to 0 to disable generation of a .iso file in the output directory.
This .iso can be used on a regular system as a LiveCD.

- compress_iso (default 1)
Set to 0 to disable squashfs compression of the filesystem on the .iso LiveCD.
This will increase the speed of the build, but the resultant .iso will be
about 3 times as big.

- make_tree_tarball (default 1)
Set to 0 to disable the generation of the LZMA-compressed filesystem tree
tarball

- customization_info (optional, suggested)
Please set this to a string that indicates your identity, to make clear that
the resultant build is a modified version of OLPC's official release.
For example, you could use something like the following when producing
an OS build for OLPC's Paraguayan deployment:

[base]
customization_info=customized by Paraguay
