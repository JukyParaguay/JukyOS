This module allows you to run custom scripts/programs which are executed quite
late in the build process: after all packages have been installed and OLPC
tweak have been made, but before checksumming and packing everything into the
appropriate image format.

Usage of this module is discouraged -- olpc-os-builder aims to allow you to
make all customizations through the configuration file, and if that is not
possible, you are encouraged to write to the devel@lists.laptop.org mailing
list, requesting the development of a specific module to meet your needs.



Your scripts will run in the regular environment of the system, with root
privileges. The environment variable $INSTALL_ROOT will be pre-set, allowing
you to locate and make any changes to the actual build through reading this
variable.

Your scripts should return 0 on success, a non-zero exit code will cause the
whole build process to fail.

Your scripts should have appropriate executable permissions and start with
the appropriate shebang pointing to an interpreter, for example: #!/bin/bash


Example configuration:

[custom_scripts]
custom_script_1=/home/xobuilds/scripts/tweak-something.sh
custom_script_2=/home/xobuilds/scripts/fix-frobber.py
