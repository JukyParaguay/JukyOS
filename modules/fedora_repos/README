This module is for enabling the various official Fedora repositories as
package sources for the build process.

Note that the yum config on the resultant system is unmodified -- use
the yumcfg module in addition to this one if you want to make the same
changes to the resultant system.

The configuration has 3 options: one for the release repo, one for updates,
and one for updates-testing. Use 1 to enable and 0 to disable.

Defaults: release and updates enabled, updates_testing disabled.


Example:

[fedora_repos]
release=1
updates=1
updates_testing=1
