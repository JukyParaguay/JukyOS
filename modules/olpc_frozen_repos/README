This module allows for easy inclusion of OLPC's mock.laptop.org static
RPM repos for the build.

Like the 'fedora' module, the resultant yum configuration on the system is
unmodified. This only affects build time. Use the yumcfg module to modify
the resultant system configuration if desired.

Configuration:

The 'mocktags' option, a comma-separated list of git tags from the 'repos'
repo which should each be used as repositories.

You can optionally mark a repository as contributing to a package excludes
list, and then apply that excludes list to certain repositories that you have
already listed in mocktags.


Example:

[olpc_frozen_repos]
mocktags=
	koji.dist-f11,
	koji.dist-f11-updates,
	local.10.1,
	local.10.1-xo1.5
build_excludes_from=local.10.1,local.10.1-xo1.5
add_excludes_to=koji.dist-f11,koji.dist-f11-updates
