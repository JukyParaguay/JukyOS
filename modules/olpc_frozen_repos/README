This module allows for easy inclusion of OLPC's mock.laptop.org static
RPM repos for the build.

Like the 'fedora' module, the resultant yum configuration on the system is
unmodified. This only affects build time. Use the yumcfg module to modify
the resultant system configuration if desired.

Configuration: a single 'mocktags' option, which is a comma-separated list of
git tags from the 'repos' repo which should each be used as repositories.

Example:

[olpc_frozen_repos]
mocktags=
	koji.dist-f11,
	koji.dist-f11-updates,
	local.10.1,
	local.10.1-xo1.5
