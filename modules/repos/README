This module lets you control which RPM repositories are included in the build.
The resultant yum configuration on the system is unmodified. This only affects
build time. Use the yumcfg module to modify the resultant system configuration
if desired.

You almost certainly want to include this module, and ensure that Fedora's
release repository (and perhaps update) or equivalent is enabled.

Everything is done through the configuration.

Firstly, the 'fedora' option:

[repos]
fedora=fedora,fedora-updates,fedora-updates-testing

This is a comma-separated list of official Fedora repositories to enable
for the build. The 3 possible options are fedora, fedora-update and
fedora-updates-testing.



The olpc_frozen_ options:

Provide any number of options with unique names that start with "olpc_frozen_"
to generate repo lines that correspond to the frozen RPM trees controlled on
mock.laptop.org.
The format of each value is a number (to determine whether the packages in
this repository are added to the exclude list), followed by comma, then
the name of the git tag of the 'repos' repo which you want to add as an RPM
repository. Example:

[repos]
olpc_frozen_1=0,koji.dist-f11
olpc_frozen_2=0,koji.dist-f11-updates
olpc_frozen_3=1,local.10.1
olpc_frozen_4=1,local.10.1-xo1.5



The olpc_publicrpms_ options:

Provide any number of options with unique names that start with
"olpc_publicrpms_" in order to generate repo lines that correspond to the
aggregation of OLPC developers public_rpms dropboxes, aggregated at
http://xs-dev.laptop.org/~dsd/repos
The format of each value is a number (to determine whether the packages in
this repository are added to the exclude list), followed by comma, then the
name of the repository. Example:

[repos]
olpc_publicrpms_1=1,f11
olpc_publicrpms_2=1,f11-xo1.5



The add_excludes_to option:

In the options documented above, you were able to append the list of packages
in a particular repository to an exclude list. This option allows you to
apply that exclude list to any of the repo lines that were generated with
the options above.

For example, this is useful to specify that packages in OLPC's "override"
repos take precedence over the official Fedora repos, even if the Fedora
repo contains a newer version of a particular package.

The add_excludes_to option value is a comma-separated list of repository
names where the exclude list should be applied. The names are the same
as the names (or tag names) of the options documented above. For example:

[repos]
fedora=fedora,fedora-updates
olpc_publicrpms_1=1,f11
olpc_publicrpms_2=1,f11-xo1.5
add_excludes_to=fedora,fedora-updates


This generates a repository configuration where fedora and fedora-updates
official repositories are used as the main package source, but OLPC's
public_rpm dropboxes are used as overrides for selected packages which have
been uploaded there.
