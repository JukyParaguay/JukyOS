This module helps with signing of builds.

It has 3 configuration options.

[signing]
extract=0
make_fs_zip=1
add_signed_content=/path/to/zip/file

"extract" causes an output file named osXX.for-signing.zip to be generated,
including all content needed for OS and FW signing (firmware, kernel,
initramfs). Default 0.

"make_fs_zip" results in an unsigned fs.zip files being created for every
.zsp file output from the build. A file named os31.2gb.zsp will result in
os31.2gb.fs.zip being created. Default 1.

"add_signed_content" is an optional setting which lets you provide a zip
file containing some combination of the following files:
	bootfw.zip runos.zip runrd.zip actos.zip actrd.zip
These will be copied to /boot in the resultant image.
The idea is that you sign these files externally, then use this module to
insert them into the next build.
