This module adds the Sugar learning environment to the build.

It has 2 optional configuration options which let you add or remove activities
from the default favorites view. Both accept comma-separated lists of activity
IDs.

Example:

[sugar]
favorites_view_add=
	org.sugarlabs.InfoSlicer,
	org.sugarlabs.IRC,
	org.laptop.StopWatchActivity,
	org.laptop.community.Finance
favorites_view_del=
	org.laptop.Terminal,
	org.laptop.Log
