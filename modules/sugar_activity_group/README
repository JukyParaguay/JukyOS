This module configures the resultant image to use a specific activity group
within the Sugar Activity Update control panel applet.

It also causes all of the activities from that group to be downloaded and
installed in the build.

You must specify the activity group URL in the configuration. Example:

[sugar_activity_group]
url=http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Activities/G1G1
