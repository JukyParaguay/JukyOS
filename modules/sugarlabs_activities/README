This module accepts a pre-configured comma-separated list of activity IDs,
downloads those activities from http://activities.sugarlabs.org and unpacks
them into the build.

Both activities and content are supported.

You can optionally provide the Sugar version number. This will cause the
downloaded activities to be limited to ones that are marked as supporting
that specific version of Sugar.

Example configuration:
[sugarlabs_activities]
sugar_version=0.84
activities=com.socialtext.SocialCalcActivity,
	org.laptop.sugar.GetBooksActivity,
	org.laptop.community.Colors
