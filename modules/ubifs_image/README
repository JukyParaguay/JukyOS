This module creates a partitioned nand filesystem image, with the first
partition as a small JFFS2 "boot" partition, and the second partition as a
UBI volume with a single ubifs "system" partition.

Output files are:
	osXXu.img
	osXXu.onu

To install on an XO, pass the onu file to the "update-nand" command at the
"ok" firmware prompt.
